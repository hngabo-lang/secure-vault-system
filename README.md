# secure-vault-system

#Hey! This is a simple bash project I built for managing secure files like encryption keys, secrets, and logs. It's got automated permissions and security checks built in.

# The structure and what's in there?

```
vault_project/
├── vault_setup.sh          - sets everything up
├── vault_permissions.sh    - handles file permissions
├── vault_ops.sh           - main menu for adding/updating stuff
├── vault_monitor.sh       - checks security and makes a report
└── vault_report.txt       - the security report (auto-generated)
```

# How to use it

Simply run these in order:

```bash
chmod +x *.sh
./vault_setup.sh
./vault_permissions.sh
./vault_ops.sh
./vault_monitor.sh
```

# What each script does
```
- vault_setup.sh: Creates a vault folder in your home directory and makes three files for storing keys, secrets, and logs.

- vault_permissions.sh: Lets you set permissions for each file. If you're not sure what to pick, just hit Enter and it'll use safe defaults (600 for keys, 640 for secrets, 644 for logs).

- vault_ops.sh: The main interface. You can add secrets, update them, add log entries, or try to access the keys (spoiler: it won't let you, that's the security part working).

- vault_monitor.sh: Scans all your vault files and checks if anything looks risky. Makes a nice report with file sizes, dates, and permissions.

# Quick example

```bash
./vault_setup.sh              # creates the vault
./vault_permissions.sh        # hit Enter 3 times for defaults
./vault_ops.sh                # play around with the menu
./vault_monitor.sh            # see what you created
```

# A few things to know

The vault gets created at `~/secure_vault/` automatically when you run the setup script. You don't need to make it yourself.

The report file (`vault_report.txt`) is generated by the monitor script, so don't try to create it manually.

The keys file is locked down - even the operations menu won't let you access it. That's intentional.

If permissions are too open (anything over 644), the monitor will flag it as a security risk.

# Note that

This system was built as a learning project for practicing bash scripting and understanding file permissions. Feel free to mess around with it!
